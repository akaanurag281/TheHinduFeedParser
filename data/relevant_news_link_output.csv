Faster economic growth requires increased share of the manufacturing sector in GDP, particularly of MSMEs. Comment on the present policies of the Government in this regard.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman emphasized the government's commitment to boosting infrastructure development in her recent budget presentation. Key highlights include a significant investment of ₹10 lakh crore in urban housing and a rural roads program worth ₹26,000 crore. The capital expenditure budget for FY25 remains at ₹11.1 lakh crore, representing 3.4% of GDP. Additionally, new initiatives such as a power plant in Bihar, investments in expressways, medical colleges, airports, and tourist circuits were announced.

The government's focus on infrastructure has played a crucial role in India's economic recovery post-COVID, making it the world's fastest-growing major economy. Infrastructure investments have doubled over the past three years to 3.4% of GDP, enhancing productivity and connectivity across industries.

The budget aims to provide opportunities for private sector participation in infrastructure projects as India targets a $5 trillion GDP by the end of the decade and aims to become a developed economy by 2047. Large business groups have already committed multi-billion dollar investments, signaling potential for smaller companies to follow suit.

With supportive capital markets and healthy bank balance sheets, financing large projects is becoming more feasible. The government's long-term vision outlined in Budget 2024 underscores its dedication to laying the groundwork for a Developed India by 2047."

1. Faster economic growth requires increased share of the manufacturing sector in GDP, particularly of MSMEs. Comment on the present policies of the Government in this regard.","The Indian real estate sector has been experiencing significant growth due to factors such as urbanization, policy reforms, increased disposable income, and positive consumer sentiments. The Finance Minister allocated ₹10 lakh crore for rural and urban areas under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna credit-linked subsidy scheme, emphasizing affordable housing and 'Housing for All'. This is expected to boost the affordable housing sector, cement, steel industries, and create employment opportunities. 

Additionally, a lower duty for women purchasing property aims to enhance property ownership and financial security for women, potentially increasing first-time home buyers. Digitization of land records will improve transparency and credit flow in both urban and rural areas, positively impacting housing demand in the long run.

The Budget focuses on employment generation and supporting micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Incentives for hiring first-time employees and credit guarantee schemes for MSMEs are expected to stimulate job creation and consumption. Infrastructure-related industries like cement, steel, machinery are likely to benefit from these measures.

The fiscal deficit is estimated at 4.9%, showing prudent fiscal management. The Budget is seen as positive for the housing sector with various initiatives that support growth. Overall, the real estate sector is expected to continue its growth trajectory with these developments."

The budget does mention the government's commitment to financing and early completion of the Polavaram Irrigation Project in Andhra Pradesh, which has raised concerns about potential flooding in adjoining areas of Chhattisgarh, particularly villages in Sukma district.

Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai praised the Budget as holistic with unlimited potential for development, stating it would be a significant step towards making a developed India and developed Chhattisgarh benefiting every section of society. He highlighted relief for the poor and farmers through promoting natural farming using traditional methods, which will boost exports of chemical-free products.

On the other hand, the Opposition Congress criticized the Budget for not providing anything significant to the State. Former CM Bhupesh Baghel expressed disappointment that only two states received attention while others were neglected. He stated that the Budget would not offer relief to common people or help combat inflation."

Besides the welfare schemes, India needs deft management of inflation and unemployment to serve the poor and the underprivileged sections of the society. Discuss.","The chapter on employment in the Economic Survey highlights the importance of employment as a crucial link between economic growth and prosperity. It notes that the quantity and quality of employment determine how economic output translates into a better quality of life for the population. The Survey points out that there has been a disconnect between economic growth, as measured by GDP estimates, and gainful employment, especially in decent jobs in the formal economy.

The Budget 2024 proposes several schemes aimed at generating jobs for youth, with an outlay of ₹2 lakh crore. The Finance Minister has introduced three 'employment-linked incentive' schemes to address the challenge of employment generation. These schemes include providing wage subsidies for first-time employees in various sectors.

The Survey presents data showing jobless growth trends, with limited growth in factory jobs and reductions in total employment in certain sectors. It also highlights the increasing proportion of self-employed individuals and unpaid workers in household enterprises. The Survey estimates that nearly 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs need to be generated annually until 2030 to accommodate the rising workforce.

The government has announced initiatives such as upgrading Industrial Training Institutes, introducing a Prime Minister's Internship program, and allocating funds for employment and skilling programs. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of jobs created through these incentive schemes and potential misuse of public funds.

Critics point out flaws in the supply-side incentive-based strategy, questioning whether existing labor demand can absorb new employees without considering market conditions and profitability. There are also doubts about the accuracy of official GDP estimates and concerns about relying solely on private sector investment to drive economic growth.

Overall, while government initiatives aim to address unemployment challenges through various schemes and incentives, there are lingering doubts about their long-term effectiveness and sustainability in creating lasting job opportunities for India's workforce."

Reforming the government delivery system through the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme is a progressive step, but it has its limitations too. Comment.","Budget 2024 has maintained similar allocations for the social sector as in previous years, despite focusing on the youth, farmers, women, and the poor. The Economic Survey highlights India's progress in social and institutional aspects due to effective government programs. However, there are disappointing allocations in Budget 2024: minimal increases in education and health budgets, stagnant MGNREGA allocation, and limited attention to critical schemes for vulnerable populations. Schemes like POSHAN and Saksham Anganwadi have seen slight increases but fall short of actual expenditure levels. There is no hope for higher salaries for workers or increased benefits for beneficiaries under various schemes. The budget also shows a shift towards contributory schemes and privatization in social spending, neglecting equity considerations. The employment challenge is expected to be addressed by private sector responses through government-sponsored internships and skill development programs with an allocation of ₹2 lakh crore over five years. However, the effectiveness of these supply-side schemes remains uncertain. Dipa Sinha, a development economist, points out the focus on incentivizing private sector employment without addressing demand-side issues like stagnant wages or reviving employment opportunities."

What are the reasons for introduction of Fiscal responsibility and Budget Management","The 2024-25 Budget focuses on priority areas such as employability, employment, productivity, resilience in agriculture and infrastructure. Tax proposals in the Budget aim to provide incentives for specific sectors and address general issues like capital markets and tax regimes. The government is shifting towards a new strategy with schemes like revised personal income tax slabs and employment-linked incentives. There is a focus on increasing taxes on capital gains to address income inequality concerns. The Budget also proposes an increase in securities transaction tax on derivatives transactions to stabilize the capital markets. Changes in tax policies aim to nudge taxpayers towards a simplified regime with fewer exemptions and concessions. The government aims to transition taxpayers towards the new regime, which has shown promising results in terms of revenue collection. However, there are concerns about the fiscal cost of this transition if repeated incentives are needed. Suggestions include announcing a prospective terminal date for the old regime to simplify the decision-making process for taxpayers."
https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-with-265-lakh-crore-outlay-railways-to-prioritise-safety/article68437321.ece,The actual operating ratio of the railways has gone up slightly to 98.22% for FY25 from 98.10% for FY23,"The setting up of a Rail Tariff Authority to regulate fares will subject the cash strapped Indian Railways to demand subsidy for obligation to operate non-profitable routes and services. Taking into account the experience in the power sector, discuss if the proposed reform is expected to benefit the consumers, the Indian Railways or the private container operators.","The Ministry of Railways has received a record allocation of over ₹2.55 lakh crore in the financial year 2024-25, marking a 5.85% increase from the previous year's allocation. The capital expenditure includes funds from various sources such as general revenues, Nirbhaya Fund, internal resources, and extra budgetary resources totaling up to ₹2.65 lakh crore. This allocation will be utilized for assets, acquisitions, construction, and replacements with a focus on safety works.

In comparison to 2014 when only ₹35,000 crore was allocated for capital expenditure on railways, the current budget estimates represent a significant increase. The emphasis is on safety first, followed by comfort, capacity enhancement, and infrastructure development according to Railway Minister Mr. Vaishnaw.

The Economic Survey highlights limited progress in safety-related works within the railways sector. The operating ratio of railways stood at 98.10% for FY2022-23 and slightly increased to 98.22% in the Budget Estimates for FY2024-25. Operating ratio indicates the amount spent to earn every hundred rupees.

Despite this positive development in funding allocation, the Union Budget has reduced the Bengaluru Suburban Railway Project's allocation by ₹100 crore. On a brighter note, approvals for Kavach 4.0 have been received which will accelerate the installation of the Automatic Train Protection system aiming at enhancing railway safety.

Mr. Vaishnaw also emphasized generating employment opportunities within railways with plans to create 38,000 to 40,000 new jobs while highlighting that up to five lakh jobs were created during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first two terms in office.

Additionally, there is a focus on new projects including connectivity with Kashmir and linking all capitals of Northeastern States along with procurement of new rolling stock and development of Vande Bharat trains and Vande Metro as part of future endeavors in Indian Railways' expansion and modernization efforts.

Do you agree with the view that steady GDP growth and low inflation have left the Indian economy in good shape? Give reasons in support of your arguments.","The FY25 Union Budget emphasizes stability and continuity in India's economic growth under the new administration. The budget focuses on making growth more inclusive by addressing issues such as uneven wealth distribution and stagnant wages. Measures in the budget aim to improve the quality of employment, strengthen agriculture, and involve MSMEs in manufacturing. Initiatives include promoting self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, investing in agriculture research, creating large-scale vegetable production clusters, and implementing Digital Public Infrastructure for farmers. The budget also prioritizes employment generation through schemes incentivizing employers and employees, internships, and skill development programs. Significant allocations are made towards housing, with a focus on urban and rural housing schemes. The PLI Scheme receives increased funding to support sectors like auto manufacturing. Measures to address financing constraints for MSMEs include facilitating term loans without collateral and improving credit assessment processes. Despite maintaining fiscal discipline, the government has introduced measures to stimulate the economy while reducing the fiscal deficit target for FY25 to 4.9% of GDP. The budget aims for a smoother transition to a 4.6% fiscal deficit in FY26 while continuing fiscal consolidation beyond that year. These efforts are expected to enhance India's economic prospects and potentially lead to a sovereign rating upgrade in the future.

Russia has been modernizing its military presence in the Arctic by reopening bases and airfields, while China has been investing in polar exploration and research. The U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defence raised concerns about growing cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic, including joint military exercises off the coast of Alaska.

The effects of climate change, such as rapidly warming temperatures and thinning ice coverage, have intensified competition in the Arctic as nations seek access to oil, gas, mineral deposits, and shipping routes. Moscow is promoting its Northern Sea Route as an alternative cargo route between Europe and Asia.

Both China and Russia defended their policies in the region, with Beijing emphasizing principles of respect, cooperation, mutual wins, and sustainability. Russia stated that it aims to prevent the Arctic from becoming a source of discord or tension and that its cooperation with China contributes to stability.

The U.S. views the Arctic as strategically important due to its proximity to U.S. defense infrastructure and potential for an ice-free summer by 2030. The U.S. Arctic strategy highlights the risks associated with increased human activity in the region, including accidents, miscalculations, and environmental degradation. As a result, U.S. forces must be prepared to address potential contingencies in the Arctic.

Overall, tensions are rising in the Arctic as countries like Russia and China expand their presence in response to climate change-induced opportunities for resource extraction and shipping routes."

Impact of the new economic measures on fiscal ties between the union and states in India. -2017","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's first Budget of the BJP-led NDA government’s third consecutive term in power focuses on addressing the concerns of India’s unemployed youth. The Budget emphasizes on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. It includes a package of five schemes aimed at creating opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of ₹2 lakh crore. One key scheme offers a month’s wage subsidy to new employees in the formal sector, while another provides internship opportunities in top companies. The Budget also addresses challenges faced by the MSME sector and offers tax relief for the salaried middle class.

In terms of fiscal consolidation, the Budget aims to reduce the Fiscal Deficit to 4.9% of GDP. However, there have been cuts in spending on social sectors like education and subsidies across various areas. Notably, spending on MGNREGA has been reduced to a nine-year low share.

Overall, while addressing political and fiscal pressures, Ms. Sitharaman's Budget attempts to strike a balance between meeting immediate needs and long-term goals for economic growth and job creation in India."
